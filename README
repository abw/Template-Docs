The Template::Docs distribution contains the source templates for the 
Template Toolkit v2 documentation and the modules and scripts used
to generate the templates from the source pod.

You only need to use this distribution if you're Andy Wardley or another
maintainer of TT wanting to rebuild the HTML documentation for a new 
release of TT2. 

If you just want a complete set of pre-built HTML documentation for TT2
then you can download it from the TT web site:

    http://template-toolkit.org/docs/

If you are Andy Wardley then you already know this (or you used to when 
you wrote it), but I'll repeat it for the sake of anyone else who might
need to know how it works.

1) Run the Makefile.PL script to generate configuration files that are
   correct for your installation.  If you're Andy Wardley, you probably 
   don't need to do this, but hey, why not do it anyway, just to be sure.

     $ perl Makefile.PL

2) Run the bin/podmods script pointing it at the TT lib directory you want
   to scan.  Like this:
   
     $ bin/podmods -v ~/tt/Template2/lib

3) Run the bin/build script to generate the HTML.  Use '-a' to make it 
   rebuild everything.  Like so:

     $ bin/build -a

The bin/build script runs ttree with the etc/ttree.cfg configuration file.
The config/main template (in templates/library) is pre-processed, so all
runtime template configuration happens from there.  The site/wrapper
template (in the same place) is used as the main wrapper around templates
so look there to see how the page layout, header, footers, etc., are added.

If this doesn't work then complain to Andy Wardley.  If you are Andy Wardley
then go and sit in the corner.  You only have yourself to blame.

If you're not Andy Wardley and you're still reading then perhaps it's 
because you're wondering if you could adapt this code to build fancy 
HTML documentation for your own modules.  Well yes, you can, but it means
hacking on the bin/podmods script which is a bit of a mess (I should know,
I've re-hacked it half a dozen times now for various different modules).  
I've made a start on refactoring it into a properly generic module, but 
that could take a while.  Apologies in advance if the twisted code makes 
you throw a fruit loop.


Making an Archive
-----------------

If you're Andy Wardley, or the current maintainer of the TT2 web site in
some future world, then this is for you.  It tells you how to generate 
the .tar.gz file for other people to download because you've almost 
certainly forgotten how to do it since last time.

1) Do everything listed above to build the documentation.

2) Run the bin/bundle script.  This will create a bundle file for the 
   version of the Template module on your system, named something like
   "TT_v224_html_docs.tar.gz".

3) Move it to the web site source dir

     $ mv TT_v221_html_docs.tar.gz ~/web/tt2.org/html/download

4) Go and edit the ~/web/tt2.org/templates/library/config/site file and 
   change tt2.version.docs to the latest version

5) Rebuild the web site download page and sync up to tt2.org

    $ cd ~/web/tt2.org
    $ bin/build download/index.html
    $ bin/pigup
